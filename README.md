# Milestone 1 : Face Generation from Noise

To ease up the development, I decided to break the project into bite size pieces. So for the first milestone, I choose to setup a GAN model such that it would automatically generate faces from random noise.

## Running

### Training from scratch

You can train the model using

```
python train.py
```

### Using Pre Trained models

comming soon.

### Generation

To boot up the web interface, run
